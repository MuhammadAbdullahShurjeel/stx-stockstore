A dynamic stock market system for RedM Roleplay servers, compatible with both **RSG** and **VORP** frameworks.

This script allows players to **sell items to a shared stock**, and **authorized job roles** (e.g. merchants, blacksmiths) to **purchase items** from that stock. Ideal for player-driven economies and realistic trade systems.
